[html][css][js][dom]

This is a zombie shooting game that was built to emulate the popular flash game on Y8 called BoxHeads(http://www.y8.com/games/box_head_2play). 

DISCLAIMER: ONLY WORKS IN CHROME ON A 15 INCH SCREEN

#The basic functionality
- you can move around a 2d space using the up, down, left and right keys

- zombies(all starting with a health of 1000) will haunt and advance towards you.

- using different types of weapons, you can kill them. But Beware! Every second that they are beside you deducts 40hp off your health (which was originally at 1000). Types of Weapons(press the corresponding number keys to access the weapons below):
    1. Pistol --> deals 200 damage
    2. Shotgun --> deals 400 damage
    3. Grenade --> will explode a few secs after it touches the floor (deals 300 damage)
    ** note: you will have a limited number of shots for weapons 2 & 3 (use them wisely)

- you win when you kill off all the zombies, you lose when your hp reaches 0 (you will regenerate when your health is damaged)
